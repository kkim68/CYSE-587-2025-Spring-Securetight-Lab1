The only package to be installed to run the simulation is pymodes:
 
 $> pip install pymodes
          or 
 $> python -m pip install pymodes


---------------------------

We used external 3rd party package called "PyModeS"
  * https://github.com/junzis/pyModeS

This package is a ADS-B/Mode-S decoder that helps decoding a message (hexadecimal string) in ADS-B format.

---------------------------

The source code we used for encoding an ADS-B message was taken from "ADSB-Out" package.
